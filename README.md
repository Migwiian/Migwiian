# Hi, I’m Ian Migwi.

I work with data at the system level. My focus is on building reliable pipelines, APIs, and analytical workflows that turn messy or unstructured data into something people can trust and use.

I’m currently building toward roles in data engineering and machine learning, with a strong foundation in data analysis. I care about clear thinking, data quality, and designing systems that reflect how organizations actually operate.

What I work on:
• Data pipelines and ETL workflows
• APIs and backend systems for data products
• Analytical and machine learning projects built end to end

Selected projects:
• Culture Monitoring System – turning large scale qualitative data into measurable organizational signals
• Nairobi Air Quality Pipeline – an automated data pipeline for monitoring environmental conditions

I’m especially interested in work that sits at the intersection of data, decision making, and real world impact.

If you’d like to connect or learn more, you can find me on LinkedIn.
